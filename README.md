[h1]About the production of modules[/h1]
This is the first time I have released my own work, and it is also a cute new moderate, which may be slightly lacking in production and copywriting.
The pictures are basically drawn by the AI trained by me. I am just a coder. If you have any questions and suggestions, welcome to give me feedback. In addition, since the author is currently a student party, the update is relatively slow outside the holidays. Of course, if there are bugs that affect the game, they will be corrected as soon as possible.


[h1]Ideas currently in mind[/h1]
Greywind Creator's Ruins event chain
Another Star Cluster {Remnant Creator}
nanobot technology, ship, weapon


[h1]Not sure (give some advice)[/h1]
Remnant Creator Event (Acts of God?)
A t-34 in reverse?
Stunned?
