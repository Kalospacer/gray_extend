I need a translator

A MOD that expands Gray Wind
This mod focuses on adding content about Gray Wind
Such as events, ships, portraits, technology
English is not my mother tongue, some parts are machine-translated, if you have any questions, please ask

Current mod extension content:
Changed Gray portrait
Gray portrait changed to animated portrait
Added events and archaeological events
New Gray Wind exclusive trait
All L-cluster events will have a gray wind event (the chance of spawning has not been changed)

Diplomatic options added:
change portrait
Let Gray Wind be a scientist


About the production of modules
This is the first time I have released my own work, and it is also a cute new moderate, which may be slightly lacking in production and copywriting.
The pictures are basically drawn by the AI trained by me. I am just a coder. If you have any questions and suggestions, welcome to give me feedback. In addition, since the author is currently a student party, the update is relatively slow outside the holidays. Of course, if there are bugs that affect the game, they will be corrected as soon as possible.


Ideas currently in mind
Greywind Creator's Ruins event chain
Another Star Cluster {Remnant Creator}
nanobot technology, ship, weapon


Not sure (give some advice)
Remnant Creator Event (Acts of God?)
A t-34 in reverse?
Stunned?
